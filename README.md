# help-print-calculate-multiple-page-numbers-for-printing
When I try to to print multiple page in a page in back and front side mode, I must to try minutes to find and type which pages is front and which back. so I wrote a program to take it so easier than before :)

In C++ code run for calculate page numbers for printing four page in every side of paper (for example A4);
for example, in a pdf with 10 page from 1 to 10, the program calculate this :

First Page: 1
Last Page: 10
Front pages:
1-4,9-12,
Back pages:
5-8,

There is a little bug in this program, any can help please correct it's simple algorithm in JS.
It was so easy on PHP, But I want to write it with JS.
So Thanks for visiting this repository, I so happy to connect with you.
